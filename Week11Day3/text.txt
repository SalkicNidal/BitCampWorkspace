Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age, 
during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic civilizations. 
Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has one of the richest histories in the region, 
having been first settled by the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries AD. 
They then established the first independent banate in the region, known as the Banate of Bosnia,[12] 
in the early 12th century upon the arrival and convergence of peoples that would eventually come to call themselves 
Dobri Bo≈°njani ("Good Bosnians").[13][14] This evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century, 
after which it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it would remain from the mid-15th to the 
late 19th centuries. The Ottomans brought Islam to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of 
the country. This was followed by annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until World War I. 
In the interwar period, Bosnia was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and after World War II, the country was granted 
full republic status in the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, 
the country proclaimed independence in 1992, which was followed by the Bosnian War, lasting until late 1995.
